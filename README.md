# ct-housing-income-analysis

We decided to make a dashboard to check out Connecticut housing prices and incomes from 2020-2024.
I am very comfortable with VSCode since we've done most of the homework through there so that was my first step, to start there.
Apart from that, VSCode helped me guide myself through the streamlit because as we all know we had homework where we had to create charts or make a dashboard ourselves as well. 

Something new we learned? 
I did some research with my partner Angee, we wanted our visualizations to look a bit better and stand out. We spoke about this for a while and thought to use Altair for our visuals. I am going to leave some links that really helped us to understand a bit of what to do. 
It made it easy for us to format everything and easy for us to compare them through years and quarters. 

These are the links (sources) for our visualizations:
